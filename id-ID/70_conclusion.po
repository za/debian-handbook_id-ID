Some ports will be gone: <literal>s390</literal> has been superseded by <literal>s390x</literal>, <literal>sparc</literal> and <literal>ia64</literal> might follow as they suffer from multiple problems (lack of recent hardware, lack of Debian porters, lack of upstream support, etc.). <command>dpkg</command> will gain a <command>--verify</command> command that renders <command>debsums</command> mostly obsolete."

msgid "The package management system will be able to install packages for several different architectures on the same system (this is known as “multi-arch support”). This will allow installing 32 bit applications on a 64 bit system, and vice-versa. Another project worth mentioning is <emphasis>Constantly Usable Testing</emphasis>, which aims at labeling <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Testing</emphasis> as an officially supported distribution that can be recommended to the general public. The default “init” process (<command>sysvinit</command>) may also be replaced by more modern systems such as <command>upstart</command> or <command>systemd</command>."

msgid "Of course, all the main software suites will have had a major release. Apache 2.4 (or newer) will have a strong impact on deployed websites as many configuration files will have to be updated. The Linux kernel is likely to have a much improved container support (with user namespaces, paving the path towards more secure containers). And the latest version of the various desktops will bring better usability and new features. GNOME 3 will be much more polished and the fans of the good old GNOME 2 will be pleased with the inclusion of <ulink url=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\">MATE</ulink> in Debian."
